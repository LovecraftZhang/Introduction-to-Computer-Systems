Observation:

Base on the result above, the time of disk reading increase as the number of block increase.

Explanation:

Since “sum = sum * 1.1 + *(((int*) buf) + 1);” and “printf ("%ld\n", sum);”, the output is the total sum of disk reads. It derives from the given two codes, so the current sum is 1.1 times the previous sum plus the next number of disk reads. Therefore, the time taken for the execution increase as the sum increase.
