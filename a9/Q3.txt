Observation:

The executing time is shorter that sRead but slightly longer than aRead.

Explanation:

That may because there are lots of threads created and this slows the program. Thread usually adds a small overhead, but if the number of threads is large, the overhead is significant. This overhead will take lots of stake space that slows the program.
