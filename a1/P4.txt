We firstly use the base case 01 02 03 04 as our input and verify its correctness. Then we try several hex values which are positive.
Also, we use ff ff ff ff as our input and verify that the output is -1 which is correct.
Finally, several other negative hex values are tested which are all correct.

Summary:
-test positive bytes into an int(0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04)
-test negative bytes into an int(0xff 0x80 0xff 0x80)
-test bytes are positive and some are negative(0x12 0xff 0x13 0x80)
